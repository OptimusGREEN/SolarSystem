<h1>SolarSystem alarm</h1>
<p>The SolarSystem alarm panel is designed to work with existing tried and tested alarm system components that work with the Honeywell Galaxy system - including keypads, Max readers, RIOs and wireless RIOs. It then works with all of the standard alarm components that work with these such as PIRs and reed switches, and so on. It should work as a drop in replacement for a Galaxy panel connecting to existing hardware.</p>
<p>There are many differences in the way it works...</p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The SolarSystem works on a small standard computer and connects to a RIO within a battery box. This provides four RS485 buses and the I/O of that RIO (8 input, 4 output). This makes the "panel" very much a replacement for a Galaxy panel in terms of I/O.</p>
<p>The hardware has Ethernet as standard and may even have WiFi depending on the hardware used.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>The configuration is not done via a keypad - indeed, a system could be set up with no keypad at all if necessary. The configuration and management uses a web interface and so needs no special software.</p>
<p>However, the configuration can also be managed as an XML file allowing system maintainers to manage centrally and generate XML files as needed.</p>
<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<p>Monitoring is via Internet, and typically an installation would have a backup such as a standard mobile router if there are issues with Internet connectivity.</p>
<p>The monitoring protocols are published and based on standards.</p>
<p>We may even support SNMP to allow linking to nagios.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Galaxy system has decades of legacy features which are not needed now - the design of the SolarSystem is designed to be simpler to understand. However, a number of new features are also included.</p>
<h2>Access control</h2>
<p>The door / access control system is a significant improvement on the Galaxy system using a Max reader.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of lock engaged sensors and monitoring mag locks.</li>
<li>Alerting for door ajar (reed switch says closed, lock says not engaged).</li>
<li>Option of additional locking when alarm set (deadlock output and lock engaged input).</li>
<li>Operation with a door bell button and optional door bell sounder (could use Internet to alert door bell by other means).</li>
<li>"air lock" mode for pairs of doors.</li>
<li>Two way max readers, i.e. one inside and one outside, on same door, whether for security or time recording</li>
<li>Door closing timer (or use of lock engaged input) allowing a door to be "bounced close/open" without causing a door force event</li>
<li>System as a whole has a "warning" state that is lower than alarm and used for door force or propped when not alarm set.</li>
<li>Option to override door propped using keyfob (for users allowed to do so)</li>
<li>Using a key fob to disarm the alarm also immediately opens the door without needing a second use.</li>
<li>Can still hold keyfob to set alarm, but setting cancelled if you open the door or use fob again, e.g. if setting was by accident.</li>
<li>Using key fob when door open can be used as a signal, such as "clocking out".</li>
<li>One user can have multiple key fobs, useful for people that do have more than one, and useful for one key fob on Max and keypad+prox as number is different.</li>
<li>Doors can be operated without a Max reader at all, just RIO inputs and outputs, e.g. for second door in "air lock" set up.</li>
<li>Doors can be locked-down so not allowed to open based on system state, e.g. input from a panic button, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Galaxy key fobs</h2>
<p>Galaxy key fobs have a printed code, and this is what is read on a Max reader. However, this is not the "real" number in the key fob (which is what is seen on the keypad with prox reader). There is no way to know the number of a Galaxy key fob using the Galaxy system - you have to read it. You can buy cheaper key fobs and can see their number on a keypad+prox, but cannot tell what number the Max reader would see, so you cannot use them.</p>
<p>The SolarSystem does not have that restriction - it reports the number of unknown keyfobs used on Max readers so they can be used in the config. This allows other makes of key fobs to be used.</p>
<h2>Max reader ID</h2>
<p>On the Galaxy it is a pain to renumber Max readers. The SolarSystem allows any Max reader to be changed to any other number quickly and simply.</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<p>RIO inputs can be set to use any resistance thresholds you like in 100 ohm steps to 25k ohm.</p>
<p>RIO input response times can be set in any time you like in 10ms steps to 2.5s.</p>
<h2>Time profiles</h2>
<p>Much simpler time profiles, including bank holiday logic.</p>
